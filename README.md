# FormGUI - converter binary form from ProReports to python code in format PySimpleGUI(TKinter)

'''ProReports''' (http://www.proreports.pl) has embedded form designer. I have prepared a program (formgui) that converts binary form ProReports to python code in format PySimpleGUI library. This can significantly speed up the creation of forms used in programs written with use of PySimpleGUI library. 

# Usage

formgui.exe <filename>.prs
```
